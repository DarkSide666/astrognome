* Refine UI                                                     :version_1.0:
  The UI is a bit messy right now, especially the aspect/antiscia
  changer buttons and the display theme changer combo box on the chart
  view.

  For the display themes, a menu button with a popover may be the best
  option. That would need a nice icon, though (possibly with some
  planet and aspect symbols).

  The current view switcher (a menubutton) doesn’t show its accels
  (maybe because of the radio menu items?). Maybe it should be put
  back to a GtkStackSwitcher. The original place for that is now used
  up by the window title and the chart name, so a new place must be
  found for it.

* Issue an error message for missing resources

  If a gres:// link cannot be loaded by the XML loaders, Astrognome
  should issue an error message, stating that this is either a bug in
  the current chart theme (in 2.0+) or in Astrognome itself.

* Preview images                                                :version_1.0:

  The database (or more likely the cache directory) should contain a
  preview image of each chart. The chart list screen should show a
  small box with the name and the preview image. Upon mouseover the
  image should blur/darken and some chart data (maybe customizable?)
  may get drawn over it.

* Customizable accels                                           :version_2.0:

  Accels should be customizable, and they may also get some more sane
  defaults. Right now they are imitating Placidus, which, in turn, is
  not very intuitive.

  The accel customization may get its place on the Preferences dialog.

  Stepping through time without actually modifying the saved chart
  data. The result would be a moving chart while it won't complain
  about saving upon close.

* Future aspect table ideas

  The aspect table may be redesigned a bit. Currently it’s just a
  GtkGrid with images or characters.

** How about extending GtkGrid itself?

** Column/row highlighting

   If possible, the row and column where the mouse points to, should
   be highlighted. This, of course, should have a setting to disable
   this behaviour. Another option is to create divisor lines between
   the rows and columns.

** Aspect/antiscion changer

   The aspects table should utilise the same changer as the chart to
   show different relations between the planets.

** Apply display themes

   The aspect and antiscion table should use the same display theme as
   the chart. If a planet, aspect or antiscion axis is not in the
   display theme, it should not be visible on the table.

* Display themes

  Currently, display themes can display/hide chart parts based on CSS
  rules. Maybe actually removing planets from the chart would make
  more sense. This, however, is not possible with aspects and
  antiscion axes. SWE-GLib should provide a solution to this.

  Planet visibility checklist:
  - planets are visible by default
  - is the planet excluded from the theme? If so, add rule
    .planet-<planetname> { visibility: hidden; }

  Aspect visibility checklist:
  - aspects are visible by default
  - is this type of aspect has to be visible? If no, add rule
    .aspect-<aspecttype> {visibility: hidden; }
  - is planet1 visible? If no, .aspect-p-<planet1> {visibility: hidden; }
  - repeat for planet2

  Antiscion visibility checklist:
  - same as for aspects

** Implement the original Astrognome theme

   The software created by Jean-André Santoni has its own list of
   planets, which is more than Classic, but obviously less than
   Everything.

** Arabic parts and fixed stars                                :version_2.0:

   As soon as SWE-GLib supports them, of course

* Chart themes

  This can get hard. What if Astrognome 1.0 supports 10 planets, 2.0
  supports 15, and I use a chart theme for 1.0 in 2.0 (or vice verse)?
  In such cases a warning should be presented to the user.

  I may use fallback icons (yeah… how?), but they may look really ugly
  on the custom theme.

* Add the East point                                            :version_2.0:

  SWE-GLib doesn’t support it yet. It is the equatorial ascendant, and
  is calculated by Swiss Ephemeris, which presents it in ascmcs\[4\].

* Support for Julian calendar                                   :version_2.0:

  It may be usable for only in the backends, like when importing a
  Placidus file with Julian date. SWE-GLib doesn’t support it yet.

* Cloud export (and maybe import)                               :version_2.0:

  GNOME Online Accounts supports some popular cloud services. It may
  be a good idea to implement saving, and possibly loading to/from
  there.

* Dynamic chart size                                            :version_1.0:

  Right now some planets may disappear from the chart because they get
  too far from the chart ring (due to @dist).

  The maximum @dist value can be get with the following XPath
  expression:

  /chartinfo/bodies/body/@dist[not(. < ../../body/@dist)][1]

* Default location                                              :version_2.0:

This is needed for the Now cart. A default location should be set in
the preferences window, which can be used by either Now charts and as
a default for new charts, although I’m not sure about the latter.

* Create nice icons                                             :version_1.0:

Most icons, especially for planets, are ugly. @droid242 is already on
it to create some nice ones.

* Create an antiscia table                                      :version_1.0:

There is only an aspects table present. We need an antiscia table,
too.

* Apply dislay theme to aspects/antiscia tables                 :version_1.0:

* Create a nice help file                                       :version_1.0:

* Add printing support

That sounds nice, but what should a printed chart contain? Chart and
aspects, for sure, and some chart data, too. Maybe an antiscia table,
if they are displayed at all.

* Add a chart information to the chart tab

In the chart tab, only the name of the chart can be seen. A chart info
display, like Placidus’ status bar, would be nice.

One idea is to use an info button on the header bar that displays the
chart info in a PopOver. This should be bound to an intuitive key
binding (Alt-Enter, Ctrl-I, I don’t know). A status bar is the other
option, but that doesn’t seem to GNOMEish…

Astrognome
==========

Astrognome was originally created be Jean-Andr√© Santoni, and was hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/astrognome/).

This project is now rewrote from scratch, using the [Swiss Ephemeris library](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/). Several ideas come from the original project, and from others, too [Placidus](http://placidus.hu/) and [Aquarius2Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wilfinger.aquarius2go&hl=hu).

The source tree contains Astrodienst's (the writers/publishers of the Swiss Ephemeris library) ephemeride files, as requested by Alois Treindl of Astrodienst in a mail written to me on 24 July, 2013.

!!!WARNING!!!
-------------

The code is a bit messy yet, and contains only two built-in charts. Dynamics will be added later.

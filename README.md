Astrognome
==========

Astrognome was originally created be Jean-Andr√© Santoni, and was hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/astrognome/).

This project is now rewrote from scratch, using the [SWE-GLib](http://github.com/gergelypolonkai/swe-glib) library (which is actually a wrapper around [Swiss Ephemeris library](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/)). Several ideas come from the original project, and from others like [Placidus](http://placidus.hu/) and [Aquarius2Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wilfinger.aquarius2go).

!!!WARNING!!!

The code is a bit messy yet, and displays calculated data only in a textual form. Graphics will be added later.

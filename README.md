#Astrognome

Astrognome is an astrologer’s software written for and utilizing the GNOME
Desktop Environment.

## Features

The features below are already implemented.

* Create natal charts for any date, time and place on Earth with exact planetary
  locations and their aspects
* Optionally include many dwarf planets and comets like Chiron and Vesta, and
  some theoretical/fictional points like the Dark Moon or the Vertex
* Optionally display mirrorpoints on several pre-defined axes
* If you don’t like these features, check out the traditional view which
  excludes Uranian planets and minor aspects
* Save your charts for later use in an XML format native to Astrognome, or
  export them as an image (even a vectorized SVG one!)
* Import your saved charts from Placidus or Regiomontanus

## Credits

Astrognome was originally created by Jean-André Santoni in Mono, and was hosted
on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/astrognome/). The original project
is now rewrote from scratch, using the
[SWE-GLib](https://github.com/gergelypolonkai/swe-glib) library (which is
actually a wrapper around the [Swiss Ephemeris
library](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/)). Several ideas come from the original
project, and from others like [Placidus](http://placidus.hu/) and
[Aquarius2Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wilfinger.aquarius2go).

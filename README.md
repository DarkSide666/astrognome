#Astrognome

## Features

The features below are already implemented.

* Calculate planetary positions for any date, time and place on Earth, their
  aspects and mirrorpoints
* Create natal charts for any date, time and place on earth, with exact
  planetary locations and their aspects (although it is very messy right now).

## Credits

Astrognome was originally created by Jean-Andr√© Santoni in Mono, and was hosted
on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/astrognome/). The original project
is now rewrote from scratch, using the
[SWE-GLib](https://github.com/gergelypolonkai/swe-glib) library (which is
actually a wrapper around the [Swiss Ephemeris
library](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/)). Several ideas come from the original
project, and from others like [Placidus](http://placidus.hu/) and
[Aquarius2Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wilfinger.aquarius2go).
